\begin{abstract}
    The Black-Scholes model and its many variants are a fundamental PDE in continuous-time finance. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction: Terminology \& Basic Concepts}

Mathematical Finance is a developed applied field in mathematics that attracts many people from the management sciences, social sciences (Economics), physics and mathematics.

The Black Scholes was a model developed by two economists in 1973 that began a revolution in Finance.
Another individual, Merton had also developed the model using the Feynman-Kac. 
 
\begin{definition}[Option]
What is an option? I have no idea man.
\end{definition}

I must take some time to define some finance topics in order to proceed without confusing anyone.



\section{Outlining the Black Scholes Model}
We begin by outlining some basic concepts about stochastic differential equations and Brownian motion. 

\section{Applied Example Using Python}

Here, I will use the formula that we have derived to do a brief numerical example using Python.
