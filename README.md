# Basic Information

This repository contains files used for my final project for my Partial Differential Equations class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (MATH 402).
Any person interested in mathematical finance with a sufficient background in PDEs should find this text approachable, and I cite resources that also present the material
in a verbose manner.

In the future, I may expand on the current code that I have on Brownian Motion (as it is really just a simulation with a set of given parameters) and
possible introduce things like Ito Calculus, Stratonovich Integrals and the like.
