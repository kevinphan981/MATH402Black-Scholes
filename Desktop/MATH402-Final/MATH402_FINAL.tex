\section{Introduction: Terminology \& Basic Concepts}

The Black Scholes was a model developed by two economists in 1973 that began a revolution in Finance.
Another individual, Merton had also developed the model using the Feynman-Kac. 


I must take some time to define some finance topics in order to proceed without confusing anyone.

Among Us

\section{Outlining the Black Scholes Model}
We begin by outlining some basic concepts about stochastic differential equations and Brownian motion. 

\section{Applied Example Using Python}

Here, I will use the formula that we have derived to do a brief numerical example using Python.
